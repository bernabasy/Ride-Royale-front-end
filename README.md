# Ride Royale


This project is designed for the reservation of fancy cars. If you are preparing for a special day or event and you want a cool car for it, this website is the best place for you. If you have a luxurious car and want to make some extra money from it, you can add it to our website and others will be able to reserve it!

Here are some of the benefits of using our website:

- Wide selection of cars to choose from
- Competitive prices
- Easy and convenient booking process
- 24/7 customer support 

Main features of this website are:
 - Users can see details of all the cars.
 - Users can reserve a car for a special day (a car that hasn't been reserved yet).
 - Users can add their own cars and remove them if they want to.
